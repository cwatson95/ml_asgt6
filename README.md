This was an assignment completed in a Machine Learning class that I took in Fall 2016 with Prof. Dave Kauchak at Pomona College.

My partner on this assignment was Madhu Jayaraman, a fellow Pomona CS major (and Math double major!). Our task was to write a gradient
descent classifier that could account for hinge loss, exponential loss, L1, L2, and no regularization.
